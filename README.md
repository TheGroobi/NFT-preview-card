## My process
The start was pretty easy, but i got stuck on the icons trying to display them in one line with the text. And Later the :hover function with overlay on an image was really hard for me to figure out.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

That i can use multiple drop shadows, how to make color overlay on hover and still getting better at positioning and layout.

### Useful resources

- [Overlay](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) - Came in very handy with overlays on :hover function.
- [Box Shadow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49189622/css-create-multiple-box-shadow) - Didn't know you could do multiple box shadows.
